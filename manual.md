Welcome to the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Fellowship program! We hope your experience this summer as a fellow will help you grow your skills as a data scientist as well as help you learn how to apply those skills to solve real-world problems with a social impact.

This manual outlines our goals in running this Fellowship program, our hopes for your experience, and our expectations of the participants. Additionally, we’ve outlined what you can expect from us and the basic structure of the program.

# Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all of our events open to external partners and the public, as well as to the fellowship itself. We hope that these things go without saying. We want to ensure that everyone who comes into the DSSG space to feel welcome, and we want to foster a safe, productive environment for fellows, staff, and visitors. 

Our Anti-Harassment Policy (below) explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a zero tolerance policy. If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated unfairly, or have any other concerns about this policy, please contact **one of your fellow advocates:**
Jane Zanzig via private Slack message or by call/text at (206) 235-6912
Rob Mitchum via private Slack message or by call/text at (773) 484-9890

## Anti-Harassment Policy

Data Science for Social Good is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in all event venues, including talks, parties, and online media, for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion, the use or display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the fellowship or fellowship events at the discretion of the organizers. Organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the fellowship or event.

If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up directly with the individual or with a DSSG staff member or fellow advocate.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the fellowship staff team with a concise description of your grievance; all grievances will be considered.

# Goals of the Fellowship

There are three main goals for this program. We know that these are lofty goals. We do not pretend to know the optimal way to achieve them, but we think it’s worth trying. We expect all of you to help us improving our program so we can acheive these goals more effectively. Our three goals (in order of priority) are:

1. [Training Our Fellows](#training-our-fellows)
2. [Introducing Data Science to Governments and Non-Profits](#introducing-data-science-to-governments-and-non-profits)  
3. [Building a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good](#building-a-community-of-data-scientists-for-social-good)  

Our overarching goal, in the long term, is for more of this type of work to happen in the world, and that our fellows are better trained, and more likely to use their skills for social good after going through the fellowship program. 

## Training Our Fellows  

   This is our number one priority.  First and foremost, DSSG is a training program. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, which is why you will work in teams with a government or non-profit project partner on a real-world project. Over the course of the summer, you will gain hands-on experience not only with data science and technical skills, but also on working with project partners, understanding social issues, learning how to use social science methods, working collaboratively on a data science team, developing solutions in an agile way, and communicating your work effectively to technical and non-technical audiences.
   
   We start the summer off with a week of orientation, making sure everyone is:
   * familiar with the goals of the program and what to expect for the next 3 months
   * getting to know each other better
   * up to speed on the tools and approaches we will use throughout the summer 

   We also provide ongoing training through lectures and workshops every week throughout the summer. This will include both training sessions on technical skills required for every data science project (from data exploration to pipeline construction to model evaluation) and sessions on concepts and skills required to work within the realm of social good. Dedicated full-time data science and technical mentors as well as project managers will support and guide you throughout the summer. For more details on curriculum content and organization, see the “Learning” section below. 
   
   In short, we want the summer to be a productive and collaborative experience for you where you learn by working on real projects.  We will support you with many types of resources for the summer. The biggest resource, however, are the other fellows in your cohort. Every fellow brings their own experience and expertise, and we aim to foster a learning environment where everyone can share their knowledge and learn from one another.

## Introducing Data Science to Governments and Non-Profits  
   
   We believe that data-driven decisionmaking isn’t something reserved for companies selling online advertisements or banks trying to detect fraud. We know that data science can help governments, non-profits, and social good organizations be more effective.
   
   All of our project partners collect data, and many use data in some way to evaluate their programs and write reports for their funders. However, most social good organizations are new to the idea that data science can increase their impact and can be used in various operational systems to help them be more effective and efficient. Through the fellowship and the projects, we aim to increase this awareness raise among our partners in particular, and among  non-profits and governments in general, of the benefits and challenges of data-driven impact work.
   
   Our project partners are partners, not clients. This means that the fellows work with the partners, not for them. We believe that the fellowship helps both partners and fellows develop a common language, and fosters a better understanding of the constraints and opportunities of applying data science for social good. Over the summer, we aim to strike a balance between learning and doing. 

## Building a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good
   We hope (and expect) that your impact as a DSSG alum continues beyond this summer. Throughout the summer, we will introduce you to other practitioners within the data science, social good, and data science for social good spaces in order to help you better understand these sectors and the potential future contributions you could make. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to network with local Chicago  data science, tech, government, non profit, and startup communties through regular fellowship-sponsored happy hours and Meetups.
   
   Whether it’s continuing to collaborate with your DSSG colleagues on other social good projects, joining the data team of a government agency, or working to recruit other like-minded people to apply their in-demand data science skills to impactful problems, we hope that this is just the beginning of your tenure as a data scientist for social good. 

# Our Hopes for Your Fellowship Experience

The fellowship provides you with the opportunity to learn, work on challenging, exciting, and unique projects, and meet a lot of people with shared interests and goals. It is up to you to make sure you take advantage of these opportunities.

We hope you might use the summer to:
* Learn about the challenges of working with real-world project partners
* Navigate the triangle between data and tech heavy work, deliverables that are actionable for your project partner, and the skills that you and your team bring to the table
* Rise to the challenge of working on a strong team with diverse experiences and strengths
* Embrace your own shortcomings as learning opportunities, exploring your limitations with respect to technical skills, new types of methods from different disciplines, project management, social issues, and teamwork
* Realize the ambiguity and uncertainty that comes with working on new problems in a traditionally less tech-savvy sector
* Explore the impact (intentional and unintentional) that working with data from real, often disadvantaged or marginalized, people might have on them
* Think deeply about the scope and limitations of technology to improve social problems
* Explore available roles in this field and find the one you are best suited to fill (or create a new one)
* Meet a group of fellows and project partners who have a wide variety of different skills and experiences; listen to and learn from them; and make new friends

Throughout the summer, we encourage you to share your ideas about how to improve the fellowship experience for yourself and others. We are constantly trying to improve the fellowship every day all summer and over each summer as learn from each cohort.

# Our Expectations of Fellows

The fellowship offers a lot of freedom to explore and learn, and some of your routines and responsibilities will project-specific; however, we expect all fellows to stick to the basic principles listed below at all times. The same principles apply to everybody else at the fellowship, including mentors, project managers, and the fellowship organizers. If you feel that anyone is not behaving in accordance with these guidelines, we invite you to bring it up constructively. If you are unsure who to address, or if you are uncomfortable doing so directly, you can bring up your concerns or suggestions with the fellow advocate.

**Be supportive, open-minded, and willing to compromise.**
- DSSG brings together fellows and partners from different backgrounds and with different skills. In fact, this might be the best resource the fellowship has to offer! Share your knowledge and your experience with each other. Be patient as you teach each other and have an open ear for your peers. 
- Things might not go as you thought they would. It is natural that at times you may be disappointed or unhappy with your team members, mentors, project partner, or the fellowship as a whole; similarly, there will be times when someone else feels that way toward you. Keep an open mind, communicate with everybody involved, and compromise. Neither your project, nor your team, nor the fellowship will be perfect. Remember that everyone involved has invested a lot in the fellowship and want all participants to be happy.

**Be professional.**
You will be working with NGOs, non-profits, and government institutions as project partners. You will also be presenting your work to and attending events with the general public. In all of these capacities you are acting as a representative of the whole DSSG community. We expect you to be professional — that is, respectful, friendly, and on time — in your conduct with partners and the public alike.

**Be resourceful and pragmatic.**
Own your own learning. Seek out resources as necessary. Don't be shy to ask others for help, but also be mindful of their time. When you notice problems or have ideas for improvements — be it in your team, your project, or the fellowship — don’t rely on others to fix them; offer your initiative. 

**Deal with conflicts maturely.**
There are many potential sources of conflict throughout the fellowship — so it is perfectly acceptable and expected that you might run into conflicts with your team, your mentors, your project, or the fellowship organizers. In any case, we ask you to be productive, pragmatic, and mature when dealing with conflicts. We have listed some of the resources available to you when working through them below.

**Take care of the space.**
DSSG offices, meeting rooms, and kitchen areas are shared spaces. It’s everybody’s job to keep the space clean and free of messes. This policy also extends to attending offsite events.

**Show up.**
We have all committed to be here for the duration of the program. The specific dates change each year, but generally the fellowship runs from Memorial Day through Labor Day. We expect you to be in the office five days a week, to attend all training sessions, occasional special events, and the final event. However, we recognize that you have a life and may have attendance conflicts. If you have any known or potential absences, you must tell DSSG staff upon your acceptance. Any additional attendance conflicts that might arise during the summer must be discussed and agreed upon by your team and project manager well ahead of time.

**Stay involved and act as a steward.**
As a member of the DSSG community, we expect a commitment from you to stay involved, even after the summer. We ask you to seek opportunities to present the work you did, whether it's at your university, company, or social good and technology events near you. We ask you to assist your team in writing publications about your project, both during and after the fellowship. We will ask you to help us with the application process in the following years by reviewing applications and interviewing candidates. We ask that you do what you're able to contribute to the DSSG mission and community.

> ________________
> ## _DON'T PANIC_
Regardless of how much experience you have, we admitted you because we believe that you can make a valuable contribution to your cohort, and we think being a DSSG fellow will help prepare you to do data science for social good in the real world. We've made a commitment to you and want to do everything we can to help you succeed. This is really important, so we'll say it again, in bold: **If you're reading this, you are here because we want you to be here and believe that you are ready to make an impact.** For example, don't worry about how much more or less productive, knowledgable, or experienced other fellows in your cohort might appear to be. It's easy to only see the people who are doing particularly well, even though in reality, everybody has more and less productive times.

# The DSSG Environment

## The Space

Each year we rent a space in downtown Chicago. While the space changes from year to year, the layout is open, with desk space for each team. There will also be private conference space for team meetings and calls with partners. Upon arrival, you will receive the conference room request and reservation policy. We also aim to provide access to a kitchen with coffee and an espresso maker. We provide a limited supply of snacks and catered meals for special events. Let us know if you have any special food restrictions.

You will learn more about space logistics (location, key card access, etc.) as they are finalized in the weeks leading up to the fellowship.

## The People

The foundation of any good project is a good team. We’ve worked to recruit and hand pick a passionate and skilled team of interdisciplinary folks that all bring unique skills to your cohort.

While the exact numbers vary by project and by year, we roughly aim to build twelve teams of three or four **fellows** each. Your teammates will be fellow graduate students and recent graduates. We aim to ensure that each team has a mix of backgrounds, from computer science, statistics, math, physical science and engineering, social sciences and public policy.

Your team will be assigned a **Junior Technical Mentor** and a **Senior Data Science Mentor**. Each Mentor will be working with four teams of fellows, supporting their growth and project. All mentors are experienced data scientists who serve as a resource for you through the project development process. Your Junior Technical Mentor will be on hand to help with hands-on technical problems and implementation questions. Your Senior Data Science Mentor will help guide you through higher-level design decisions.

In addition to Technical Mentors, you will have a **Project Manager**. Each Project Manager oversees four teams and is responsible for managing your relationship with your project partner. They work with you and your partner to set goals and deadlines, they ensure proper communication between your team and your partner, and they help tackle issues that are blocking your success. Your Project Manager is also a great resource when you have questions about organizing team work, improving presentation skills, and communicating with the public.

If fellows have any kind of questions or concerns that they would like to discuss in confidentiality — or for which they are not sure who to talk to — they can address the **Fellows’ Advocate**. This is a member of staff who is not involved in managing the fellowship, and who is available to help with any conflict between fellows and members of staff, should they arise. The Advocate can also raise any concerns or ask for any help on behalf of fellows, should they feel uncomfortable doing so themselves.

The fellowship has several **Interns**, who help with all organizational and administrative tasks that the summer brings, like setting up the space, helping with events and seminars. In their remaining time, the interns might also help teams with their projects.

The **Communications Manager** prepares media and press releases and manages interactions with the press. The Communications Manager helps fellows practice and polish their final presentations, and gives feedback on blog posts and other write-ups. We strongly believe in the importance of communicating the work we do, to our project partners, as well as to the broader public. To that end, we will spend a lot of the summer asking fellows to present their work and give them continuous feedback on the presentations.

The **Fellowship Organizers** have spent months planning and preparing the summer program. They select fellows, mentors, project managers, interns, and project partners, find a space, secure funding, prepare the summer’s curriculum, and plan all fellowship events. Over the summer, they will lead some of the fellowship-wide activities (such as the weekly deep dives and stand-ups), and teach some of the workshops. They also supervise the mentors, project managers, interns, and the communications manager.

## The Learning

Our goal is for you to learn a LOT this summer. We want you to feel empowered to drive your education throughout the summer. We see learning opportunities falling into three main buckets:

* **Self-Directed Learning**: We will share specific resources and guidelines for topics that we find useful in order to kick-start this learning process. We then encourage you to dive in and learn the skills most applicable to you and your growth.
* **Peer-Directed Learning**: We aim to create an environment that facilitates learning among fellows. Whether it’s an informal discussion over lunch or a more formal teaching session, we encourage you to take advantage of the diversity of experiences and skills in the room.
* **Fellowship-Directed Learning**: Lastly, we have developed a specific workshop curriculum to cover basic concepts that we believe are essential for the summer.

As stated previously, it is up to you to make sure you are seeking the resources you need to learn the skills you want to learn. For example, in the past, groups of fellows have started Reading Groups to tackle similar goals together. That being said, if you are lost, speak up. You shouldn't feel that you are unable to make a meaningful contribution to your project. Your Technical Mentor is available to help you tackle skill gaps.  

In all of this, we recognize that there is no definitive “Data Science for Social Good” curriculum or roadmap. We are charting new territory and developing it together. Throughout the summer, there will be plenty of opportunities for feedback and brainstorming on how to improve learning; for example, we run an informal “Dunkin’ Discussion” series where we discuss the future of data science in the social good space over donuts.

## The Tools

We typically use GitHub for storing our codebase, Amazon Web Services for our data storage and analysis, Slack for fellowship-wide communication, and Trello for project management. We also store team-wide and fellowship-wide documents on Google Drive, and we schedule meetings on Google Calendar. You will receive a University of Chicago email address to use for the duration of the fellowship.

## The Communication

Teams will work together to develop specific team norms, but each team will have a morning stand up meeting with their project manager and technical mentors. In these meetings, each fellow will have the opportunity to discuss what they did yesterday, what they’re planning to do today, and what they’re stuck on.

In addition to that daily meeting, teams will have weekly conference calls with their project partner to provide updates, ask questions, and receive feedback on their progress.

## The Fun

While this is a job — and we expect you to treat it as such — we would hate for the summer to be all work and no play. We want to help foster a community among your cohort. 

We start the summer off with a fellowship-wide picnic, a variety of icebreakers and a scavenger hunt to get to know Chicago. We host “Un-DSSG”, a day where you get to share your side passions (from fondue making to dance) with your new peers. Throughout the summer, we host happy hours every other week and invite the larger Chicago data science, tech, startup, government, and non-profit communities. Nearly daily, we pull out the ping pong table after hours, often leading to intense tournaments. You might want to brush up on that before summer starts.

# Summer Workflow

We get a lot of questions about what to expect in terms of the arc of the summer. While the specific timing will vary by project, below is the general plan most projects will follow.

## Before the Summer

Prior to your arrival, we will send you a variety of pre-training resources so you can start working with and learning how to use the tools you’ll use all summer. These resources will include a list of software to install prior to your arrival and tools/programming languages you should brush up on. We will also send you a list of projects and ask for your preferences on which projects you'd like to work on in the summer. Based on your preferences, the needs of the project, and the balance of disciplines for each team, we will create a team of 3-4 fellows for each project.

## Learning about Projects and Partners

Year-round staff at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy (DSaPP) work hard to recruit and scope projects throughout the year. Because of various logistical hurdles (think legal data sharing agreements and data transfer challenges), project partners will be finalized on an on-going basis all the way up to the start of the fellowship. As such, you will not receive your project assignment until the second week of DSSG.

After orientation, you will spend the first part of the summer getting to know your project partner and their challenges. While the project will have been initially scoped, you will have the opportunity to refine that scope by working with your project partner throughout the summer. For example, we may have initially worked with a project partner to determine a goal of finding violations of a particular law or code. Your team would then work with the partner to narrow that to: (1) locations at risk of violations in general; (2) locations at risk of multiple violations; or (3) locations with the most impactful violations.

While we know you are eager to dig into data immediately, data science for social good is not just about data and cannot happen in a vacuum. We believe that it is important for you to thoroughly understand the problem you are trying to solve and underlying issues in order to approach your solution more intentionally. Not only do evaluation metrics depend on your specific goals, but understanding and knowledge of the problem is crucial in understanding what your variables even mean. To help with that initial context, most project partners will come on site during the first two weeks and spend a couple of days with their team.

## Working on Your Project

We aim to have all data from project partners well in advance of the fellowship, but that's never really possible. We sometimes have delays in getting data or get partial data that needs to be augmented during the fellowship. As you explore the data, you'll find holes in the data that was provided and will need to work with the project partner to fix that. That’s the reality of working with partners that collect sensitive data.

Fellows drive the work of every project, learning their subject matter in depth, writing code, and collaborating with their project partner on their final deliverables. Over the course of the summer, your team will:

* Explore your data
* Design your project workflow
* Identify user stories
* Develop a machine learning pipeline
* Build relevant models
* Improve feature and pipeline engineering
* Evaluate using the metrics that make sense for your project
* Develop additional final deliverables (API, dashboard applications, etc) 

## Presentations

We believe that our work is only useful if we are able to communicate about it with our partners, peers, as well as the general public. As such, an important piece of this training program is learning to present about the work you do. 

Each week, a member of your team will give a 2-3 minute update to the entire fellowship, outlining your progress to date and the work you aim to complete the following week. Twice during the summer, your team will present a 20-minute deep dive, outlining the more technical components of your project and seeking feedback from other fellows and mentors.

At the end of the summer, your team will develop two polished presentations: one 5-minute presentation for the final DSSG Data Fest event, and one 20-minute technical presentation for use at conferences, local Meetup events, and presenting at your home institution. Each group will be assigned a local meetup to give their presentation. In preparation for the DSSG Data Fest, our communications staff will work with you on both of these presentations, brainstorming ways to present your work and providing feedback on your delivery. 

## Wrap-Up and Handovers 

We want to make sure the work you do over the summer has real impact. For that impact to happen, a lot more needs to be done after you finish the summer. Some of that work is done by the project partner, some of it is done by the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago, and some of it may even be one by the fellows who continue to stay involved. What is critical for that follow-up work to take place is that you wrap up and document your work well so that others can continue and sustain your efforts. We also need to make sure that we transition the work over to the project partners so they can continue to extend, validate, implement, and deploy your work.

## A Typical Week

We are often asked what a day or a week in the life of a DSSG fellow looks like. To get a better sense of what to expect, take a look at a sample schedule below. This is a rough schedule so don't take it too literally - we've created it to give an idea of what the summer roughly looks like.
